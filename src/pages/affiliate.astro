          <p class="mb-0">
            AutoInsureGuides is a free resource for drivers. We generate revenue through:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2">
            <li><strong>Affiliate Partnerships:</strong> We earn commissions when you click on links to insurance comparison sites and purchase policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Display ads from Google AdSense and direct insurance advertisers.</li>
            <li><strong>Sponsored Content:</strong> Occasionally, we publish sponsored articles clearly marked as such.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in complete transparency about how we operate and how we're funded. This page explains our business model and how it affects the content we publish.
        </p>

        <h2>Affiliate Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
          We have affiliate relationships with several insurance comparison platforms and companies, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Zebra</li>
          <li>Bankrate</li>
          <li>Policygenius</li>
          <li>SelectQuote</li>
          <li>And other insurance providers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you click on a quote comparison link or button on our site and subsequently purchase insurance through that partner, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertising Revenue</h2>
        <p>
          We display advertisements through Google AdSense and direct partnerships with insurance companies. These ads help keep our content free for all users.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strive to ensure that ads are relevant to our audience and clearly distinguishable from our editorial content.
        </p>

        <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Our revenue sources do not influence our editorial content.</strong> We maintain strict separation between our business operations and editorial decisions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not accept payments to alter reviews or ratings</li>
          <li>All product comparisons are based on objective criteria</li>
          <li>Sponsored content is always clearly labeled</li>
          <li>We disclose affiliate links when relevant</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Choose Partners</h2>
        <p>
          We only establish affiliate relationships with companies that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have strong financial ratings (A or better from AM Best)</li>
          <li>Maintain positive customer service records</li>
          <li>Offer competitive pricing</li>
          <li>Provide transparent terms and conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Experience & Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          We're committed to providing a positive user experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We limit the number of ads on each page</li>
          <li>We don't use intrusive pop-ups or auto-play videos</li>
          <li>We respect user privacy and comply with all data protection regulations</li>
          <li>We provide clear opt-out mechanisms for data collection</li>
        </ul>
