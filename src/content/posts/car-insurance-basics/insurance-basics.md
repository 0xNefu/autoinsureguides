# Understanding Car Insurance

New to car insurance? Start here:

## Liability Coverage
Covers damage YOU cause to others. Required in every state.

## Comprehensive & Collision
Covers damage to YOUR vehicle. Optional but often required by lenders.

## Deductibles
The amount you pay before insurance kicks in. Higher deductible = lower premium.
