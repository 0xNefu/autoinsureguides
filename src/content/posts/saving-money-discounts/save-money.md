# Start Saving on Car Insurance Today

Car insurance is a necessary expense, but it doesn''t have to be expensive. Here are three quick ways to start saving:

## 1. Compare Quotes Annually
Rates change constantly. Shopping around could save you 20% or more.

## 2. Ask About Discounts
Most drivers qualify for at least one discount they don''t know about.

## 3. Adjust Your Coverage
Make sure you''re not over-insured or under-insured.
