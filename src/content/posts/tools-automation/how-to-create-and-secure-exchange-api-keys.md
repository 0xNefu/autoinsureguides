# How to Create & Secure Exchange API Keys (Step-by-Step)

If you plan to use **crypto trading bots, automation tools, alert systems, or custom dashboards**, you will eventually need to create **exchange API keys**.

API keys are powerful — and if misconfigured, dangerous.

This guide shows you **exactly** how to:
- Create API keys on crypto exchanges
- Configure permissions correctly
- Secure your keys against hacks and misuse
- Avoid the most common (and costly) mistakes

This is required reading before using:
- Trading bots
- Portfolio trackers
- Alert systems
- Automation scripts

## What Are Exchange API Keys?

An **API key** allows third-party software to interact with your exchange account.

Depending on permissions, an API key can:
- Read balances
- View open orders
- Place buy and sell trades
- (Optionally) withdraw funds

**You control the permissions.**  
Good security starts here.

---

## When Do You Need API Keys?

You typically need API keys to use:
- Crypto trading bots
- Grid or DCA automation
- Advanced analytics platforms
- Custom dashboards
- Tax and reporting tools

You do **not** need API keys just to buy crypto manually.

If you’re still early-stage, see:

## Step 1: Log Into Your Exchange Account

Log into your exchange (Binance, Bybit, Kraken, OKX, etc.) and navigate to:

**Account Settings → API Management**

Most exchanges place API controls under:
- Security
- Advanced Settings
- Developer Options

---

## Step 2: Create a New API Key

Create a **new API key** and:
- Give it a clear name (e.g., “TradingBot-Spot”)
- Never reuse old keys
- Use one key per tool

This helps with tracking and revoking access later.

---

## Step 3: Set Correct API Permissions (Critical)

This is the most important step.

### Recommended Permissions for Trading Bots

Enable:
- ✅ Read account info
- ✅ Spot trading (or futures if needed)

Disable:
- ❌ Withdrawals
- ❌ Internal transfers
- ❌ Account modification

**Never enable withdrawals** unless you fully trust the software — which you usually shouldn’t.

---

## Step 4: Enable IP Restrictions (If Available)

Many exchanges allow **IP whitelisting**.

If the tool provides fixed IPs:
- Add only those IP addresses
- Block all others

This prevents keys from being abused even if leaked.

---

## Step 5: Save & Store Keys Securely

When keys are generated, you’ll receive:
- API Key
- Secret Key (shown once)

Best practices:
- Store keys in a password manager
- Never save them in plain text
- Never upload them to GitHub
- Never share screenshots

---

## Step 6: Connect API Keys to Your Tool

Paste the API credentials into:
- Trading bots
- Automation dashboards
- Analytics platforms

Most tools will test the connection automatically.

If the connection fails:
- Double-check permissions
- Check rate limits
- Confirm spot vs futures access

---

## Common API Key Security Mistakes

Avoid these at all costs:

- Enabling withdrawals
- Reusing the same key everywhere
- Leaving unused keys active
- Ignoring IP restrictions
- Using unknown or unverified tools

Automation multiplies mistakes — small errors become expensive fast.

---

## How to Revoke or Rotate API Keys

If you stop using a tool:
1. Go back to API Management
2. Delete the API key
3. Create a new one if needed

Rotate keys periodically, especially if:
- You suspect exposure
- You change tools
- You scale trading size

---

## API Keys and Trading Bot Safety

API keys are safe **if configured correctly**.

Bots cannot:
- Steal funds
- Move assets off the exchange
- Change account settings

Unless **you allow it**.
