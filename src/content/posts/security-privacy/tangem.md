# 🛡️ Eliminating Risk: Setting Up Your Tangem Card Wallet

The Tangem Wallet takes a radically different approach to cold storage: it's a battery-free card that uses Near-Field Communication (NFC) to sign transactions directly on its chip, eliminating cables, screens, and most importantly, the paper Secret Recovery Phrase (Seed Phrase).

## Phase 1: Purchase and Initial Security Check

### 🛑 Security First: Where to Buy Your Tangem

The security of your keys starts the moment you purchase your hardware.

> **CRITICAL WARNING: Tangem wallets are designed to be tamper-proof, but you must still avoid third-party resellers (like eBay or unauthorized Amazon listings).**
> Only purchase directly from the manufacturer to ensure the cards have not been tampered with or replaced in the supply chain. The first step of setup verifies the card's authenticity.

**Always purchase directly from the manufacturer.**

### ⚖️ Comparing the Tangem Models

Tangem sells packages of cards, as redundancy is built into the product itself. The choice depends on your need for backup cards.

| Model | Approx. Price (USD) | Key Features | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2-Card Set** | $55 | One card for daily use, one physical backup card. | Beginners, budget-conscious users, and minimalists. |
| **3-Card Set** | $70 | One card for daily use, two separate backup cards. | Excellent redundancy, separating backups for maximum security (e.g., home safe, deposit box). |
| **Tangem Ring** | $160+ | Wearable ceramic ring with NFC, plus 2 standard backup cards. | Mobile-first users prioritizing convenience and style. |

## Phase 2: Card Setup and Key Generation (Seed-less)

The Tangem setup is entirely mobile-first, requiring a smartphone with NFC capabilities.

### Step 1: Install the Tangem App
* Download and install the official **Tangem Wallet** app from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. There is no desktop application.

### Step 2: Scan and Create Wallet
1.  Open the Tangem app. Tap **"Scan Tangem."**
2.  Hold one of your cards (the primary card) against the NFC sensor area on the back of your phone.
3.  The app will perform an **Authenticity Check** to confirm the card is genuine.
4.  Select **"Create Wallet."** Scan the primary card again. **This is the step where the private key is generated offline, directly on the card's secure chip, using a True Random Number Generator (TRNG). The key never leaves this chip.**

### Step 3: Set Access Code
1.  The app will prompt you to set an **Access Code** (a PIN/password). This code protects your card against physical theft by preventing transactions without it.
2.  Enter a strong, unique Access Code and confirm it.

### Step 4: Create Multi-Card Backup
**This replaces the paper seed phrase.**

1.  The app will guide you through the backup process. You must have at least one unused Tangem card from your set.
2.  Tap **"Add Backup Card."** Scan the backup card (Card #2).
3.  The secure key is cloned directly from your primary card's chip to the backup card's chip via an encrypted channel (NFC). The key is **never** shown on your phone screen during this process.
4.  If you have a third card, repeat the process with Card #3.
5.  Scan all cards one final time to finalize the backup process.

> **CRUCIAL: All cards are now identical copies. Any one of them can access the wallet. Treat all cards as equally valuable backup devices.**

## Phase 3: The Tangem Backup Deep Dive

### 🔑 The Seed-less Security Model

Tangem's main differentiator is eliminating the Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) vulnerability:

* **No SRP Exposure:** By default, no 12 or 24-word phrase is ever generated or displayed. This eliminates the single greatest point of failure for crypto users: human error (losing the paper, taking a photo, typing it into a malicious site).
* **EAL6+ Security Chip:** The private key is permanently stored and locked within the secure element chip (the same standard used in passports). The key cannot be extracted or exported, even by Tangem.
* **Chip-to-Chip Backup:** Your backup is entirely physical. Instead of a paper key, you have 2 or 3 physical cards. If one is lost, you use a backup card to access your funds.

### 📝 Optional: Using a Traditional Seed Phrase (BIP39)

If you prefer to maintain a traditional paper backup compatible with other wallets (Ledger, Trezor), Tangem provides an option:

* You can choose to **Generate** a 12- or 24-word BIP39 phrase *in the app*, write it down on paper, and then securely import it onto your cards.
* **Warning:** This process requires the phrase to be displayed on your phone screen, introducing the very risk Tangem aims to eliminate. Only use this method if you prioritize compatibility over Tangem's native security model.

### 🏠 Best Practices for Storing Tangem Cards

Since the cards are your backup, their physical security is paramount.

* **Three-Location Rule (Recommended for 3-Card Set):** Store each card in a different, separate, secure location.
    * Card 1: Your daily carry wallet (protected by the Access Code).
    * Card 2: A fireproof safe at home.
    * Card 3: A safety deposit box or a trusted relative’s home.
* **Protection:** The cards are IP68 (waterproof/dustproof) and temperature-resistant, but they should still be protected from severe physical damage.

## Phase 4: Maintenance and Funding

### 🔄 Firmware and Maintenance

Unlike traditional hardware wallets, Tangem cards are designed to be maintenance-free:

1.  **No User Firmware Updates:** The firmware on the chip is immutable (cannot be changed by the user). This eliminates the risk of malicious firmware installation.
2.  **No Battery/Cables:** The card is powered entirely by your phone's NFC field, meaning zero maintenance or charging is ever needed.

### 💸 Funding Your Cold Storage

Your Tangem wallet is immediately ready to receive funds once the Access Code is set and the backup is finalized.
