# 🛑 Stop the Drain: A Step-by-Step Guide to Revoking Token Approvals on Solana

If you’ve been following our guides on airdrop farming, you’ve connected your wallet to several new and experimental protocols. Every time you used a DEX, staked tokens, or interacted with a dApp, you likely gave that smart contract a crucial permission: **the ability to spend your tokens.**

This process is called **Token Approval** or **Delegation**, and it is the single largest security risk in crypto next to giving away your seed phrase.

## 1. What is a Token Approval (Delegation)?

When you sign a transaction to approve a token on Solana, you are delegating a portion (or often an **unlimited** amount) of a specific token to a smart contract.

* **Example:** When you use a DEX (like Raydium) for the first time, you give its contract permission to spend your USDC on your behalf to complete the swap.

### ❌ The Critical Danger: Unlimited Access

Many contracts, especially high-risk memecoin platforms, ask for an **unlimited approval**. If that contract is later hacked, exploited, or if the developers behind a small project turn malicious (a 'soft rug'), the attacker can use the previously granted unlimited permission to **drain your wallet of that specific token**, even if you have since disconnected your wallet from the website!

**Disconnecting your wallet DOES NOT revoke the permission.**

## 2. The Solution: Revoking Permissions

To maintain a secure "Wallet Hygiene," you must periodically check your wallet and **revoke** any permissions you no longer need. This cuts off the contract's access, neutralizing the risk.

### 🛠️ The Best Tool: Famous Fox Federation Revoke Tool

On Solana, the most widely used and trusted community tool for managing and revoking token approvals is the **Famous Fox Federation's (FFF) Revoker**.

### Step-by-Step Revocation Guide:

Follow these steps to clean your wallet and protect your funds.

**1. Access the Revoke Tool:**
* Navigate to the official Famous Fox Federation Revoke Tool website. **Always verify the URL to avoid phishing scams.**
* *Note: This process uses a minimal amount of SOL for the network transaction fee (gas).*

**2. Connect Your Wallet:**
* Click the **'Connect Wallet'** button and select the wallet you want to check (e.g., Phantom or Solflare).
* **Use your Burner Wallet** first if you were following our farming strategy.

**3. Review Active Approvals:**
* Once connected, the tool will display a list of all tokens in your wallet that have active spending approvals (delegations) granted to various smart contracts.
* The list will show:
    * The **Token** (e.g., SOL, USDC, a specific memecoin).
    * The **Delegated Authority** (the contract address that has permission).

**4. Identify Unwanted Approvals:**
* Look for permissions you no longer need. Any DEX, lending protocol, or token launch site you used weeks ago should be considered for revocation.
* **Prioritize revoking approvals for tokens you hold large amounts of (like USDC or SOL).**

**5. Revoke the Permission:**
* Click the **'Revoke'** button next to the specific token approval you want to remove.
* Your wallet (e.g., Phantom) will pop up, asking you to sign the transaction. **Confirm the transaction.**

**6. Confirmation:**
* Once the transaction confirms (usually within seconds on Solana), the smart contract's delegated spending authority is immediately and permanently removed. You will see the approval disappear from the list.

## 🔒 Final Wallet Hygiene Checklist

* **Periodic Checks:** Make it a habit to check for and revoke unwanted approvals **monthly** or immediately after interacting with a new/untested protocol.
* **Burner Wallet Protection:** Remember, even with the Burner Wallet strategy, you still need to revoke approvals within the Burner Wallet itself to protect the funds you keep in it for farming.
* **Never Sign Unknowns:** Be extremely cautious of any pop-up asking for "unlimited" spending or a signature request you don't recognize.
