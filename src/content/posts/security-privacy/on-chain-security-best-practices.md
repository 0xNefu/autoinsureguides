## Introduction to On-Chain Security in 2026

On-chain threats have become one of the largest sources of crypto losses. Unlike traditional hacks, these attacks exploit user-signed transactions directly on the blockchain. Wallet drainers, infinite token approvals, and malicious smart contracts can empty holdings in seconds after a single mistaken signature.

As DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain activity grow in 2026, understanding on-chain security is no longer optional for intermediate and advanced users. Beginners also benefit from early habits that prevent irreversible mistakes.

This guide covers practical, actionable best practices to protect EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) and Solana wallets. Combine these with offline storage from our [best hardware wallets guide](/blog/security-privacy/best-hardware-wallets-2026).

## Understanding Key On-Chain Threats

### Token Approvals and Infinite Spend

When you interact with DeFi protocols or NFT marketplaces, you often approve tokens for spending. Many contracts request unlimited amounts, allowing them to transfer your tokens anytime later.

Drainers exploit old approvals on dormant tokens.

### Malicious Contract Signatures

Fake airdrops, mints, or "claim reward" sites prompt signatures that directly transfer assets or set dangerous approvals.

### Permit and Permit2 Signatures

Off-chain signature standards used by advanced protocols can be abused if signed blindly.

### Blind Signing Risks

Some wallets hide full transaction details, leading to unintended actions.

## Core On-Chain Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Transaction Simulation Tools

Modern wallets include simulators that preview outcomes before signing.

**Recommended Tools:**
- Wallet-built simulators (Ledger, Trezor, Phantom)
- Third-party tools like Tenderly or Photon for EVM
- Solana's built-in preview in Phantom

Always check what a transaction actually does.

### 2. Revoke Token Approvals Regularly

Remove old or unlimited approvals to limit damage from compromised contracts.

**For EVM Chains:**
- Use free revoke tools (Revoke.cash, Etherscan Token Approval checker, or DeBank)
- Focus on high-value tokens first
- Revoke unused approvals monthly

See our existing [EVM revoke guide](/blog/security-privacy/how-to-revoke-evm) for step-by-step instructions.

**For Solana:**
- Use Solana Token Revoke tools or Phantom's built-in approval manager
- Revoke SPL token approvals and close empty associated token accounts

### 3. Limit Approval Amounts When Possible

Many newer protocols allow setting exact spend limits instead of unlimited.

Choose limited amounts for one-time interactions.

### 4. Use Dedicated Signing Addresses

Advanced strategy: Keep a separate hot wallet for DeFi interactions with limited funds. Use hardware wallets only for final transfers to cold storage.

### 5. Verify Contracts Before Interacting

- Check official project links
- Review audit reports
- Confirm contract addresses on multiple sources
- Watch for verified badges on explorers

### 6. Enable Wallet Security Features

- Set spend limits where available
- Use session timeouts
- Enable transaction confirmation on hardware devices
- Turn on phishing protection lists

### 7. Protect Against Address Poisoning

Scammers send tiny transactions from similar-looking addresses to trick copy-paste.

Always verify full addresses, especially first and last characters.

### 8. Use Privacy Tools to Reduce Targeting

VPNs hide your IP and location during interactions—see our [best VPNs for crypto](/blog/security-privacy/best-vpns-crypto-2026). Avoid linking real identity to active wallets.

### 9. Monitor On-Chain Activity

Set alerts for large transfers or approvals using tools like:
- Etherscan watch lists
- DeBank portfolio tracking
- Solana Explorer notifications

### 10. Practice Safe Minting and Claiming

Legitimate projects rarely require blind signatures. Verify mint sites through official Discord, X, or websites.

## EVM vs Solana: Key Differences in Protection

| Aspect               | EVM Chains                          | Solana                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Approval System     | ERC-20 Approve/Permit              | SPL Token Approve                       |
| Revoke Tools        | Revoke.cash, Unrevoked              | Phantom built-in, Solana Revoke          |
| Common Drainers     | Unlimited approvals + setApprovalForAll | Authority delegation exploits          |
| Simulation Support  | Strong (Tenderly, Wallet simulators)| Growing (Phantom preview)               |

## Building Long-Term Habits

Treat every signature as potentially dangerous. The cost of caution is minimal compared to total loss. Start with small test transactions on new protocols.

Combine on-chain hygiene with offline security: Store most assets in hardware wallets and only move what you need for active use.

## Conclusion: Take Control of Your On-Chain Safety

On-chain security in 2026 requires proactive habits rather than reactive fixes. Regular revokes, transaction simulation, and limited approvals dramatically reduce risks.

Implement these practices today:
- Revoke old approvals using our guides
- Upgrade to secure hardware from our [2026 recommendations](/blog/security-privacy/best-hardware-wallets-2026)
- Avoid phishing with knowledge from our [phishing attacks guide](/blog/security-privacy/crypto-phishing-attacks-2026)

Stay vigilant—self-custody means full responsibility, but also full control.
